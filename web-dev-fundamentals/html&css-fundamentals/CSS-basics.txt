CSS basics :

Type selectors -- matches elements by node name (e.g. div, li, a, p)
Class selectors -- matches elements by class name (e.g. <button class=“active”>)
ID selectors -- matches elements by ID name (e.g. <div id=”list-1”>)
Universal selectors -- matches elements of any type (e.g. *)

Descendant selectors :

The descendant selector is represented by two selectors with just white space in between them
(syntax: A(spaces, tabs, line breaks)B). This will select any element (B) that is a descendant of the first element (A).


Direct child selector :

The > selector selects nodes that are direct children of the first element (syntax: A > B).
It will match every element B that is immediately nested inside an element A. This is different
than the descendant selector because it selects only the direct children of an element.

Adjacent sibling selectors :

The + selector selects adjacent siblings (syntax: A + B). This means that the second element (B) directly
follows the first (A), and both share the same parent.

Pseudo-classes :
A pseudo-class specifies a special state of the selected element(s) and does not refer to any elements or
attributes contained in the DOM (hence, pseudo). A pseudo-class is formed by a selector followed by a colon
followed by the pseudo-class name (syntax: A:B).
