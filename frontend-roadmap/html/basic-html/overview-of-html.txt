Overview of HTML

HyperText Markup Language  is the standard markup language for describing the structure
of documents displayed on the web.

Elements

HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets (< and >).
HTML is very, very forgiving.
Void elements are all self-closing elements and are represented by one tag.
Void elements include <br>, <col>, <embed>, <hr>, <img>, <input>, <link>, <meta>, <source>,
<track>, and <wbr>, among others.

Attributes

These extra bits of space-separated name/value pairs (though sometimes including a value is optional)
are called attributes. Attributes are what make HTML so incredibly powerful.
HTML is not case-sensitive, but some attribute values are.

Element, attributes, and JavaScript

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the structure and content
of the HTML document. As the browser parses HTML, it creates a JavaScript object for ever
element and section of text encountered. These objects are called nodesâ€”element nodes and text nodes, respectively.
