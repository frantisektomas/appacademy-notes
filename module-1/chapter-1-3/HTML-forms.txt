HTML forms :

HTML Forms are one of the oldest types of interaction between a person and an
application. Forms allow users to enter data. Then, your application can decide to
send it somewhere or do something with it locally.

<form action="/form-handling-url" method="post">

</form>

The action attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
The method attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with. Browsers support only two values for
this attribute: "get" and "post". You will use "post" 99% of the time.
