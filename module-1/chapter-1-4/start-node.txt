Node.js

Since JavaScript is a single programming language, you may be wondering why there are any differences between Node.js
and browsers in the first place. If they are in fact different, why wouldn't you classify them as different programming
languages? The answer is complicated, but the key idea is this: even if you just consider browser environments, different
browsers themselves can differ wildly because JavaScript is a specification.

To get started, open up your Terminal. Then open the Node REPL by running the following command:

node file

This opens the Node shell which allows you to write JavaScript that executes immediately, line by line.

Unit Tests:
Purpose:

Verify that individual units of code (functions, methods) work correctly in isolation.
Early detection of bugs and issues in the development process.
Characteristics:

Isolation: Test one unit at a time, ignoring external dependencies.
Automation: Tests are automated, executed by testing frameworks.
Repeatable: Consistent results with each test run.
Testing Process:

Setup: Prepare the necessary environment for the test (initialize variables, set up mock objects).
Execution: Run the unit test on the specific function or method.
Assertion: Check the result against expected outcomes.
Teardown: Clean up resources, reset state if needed.
Testing Frameworks:

Popular frameworks include JUnit (Java), NUnit (.NET), pytest (Python), and Jasmine (JavaScript).
Benefits:

Identify Issues Early: Catch problems during development rather than in later stages.
Simplify Debugging: Isolate issues to specific units, making debugging easier.
Ensure Code Stability: Confidence that changes donâ€™t break existing functionality.
